## Creep.js

Quickly add smooth scrolling to any links in your site using this simple plugin.

*****

### Get Started

The only file you need (besides a jQuery library) is jquery.creep.min.js. The included css file is only for the example page. Since it's so small, it should ideally get minified and included with your other JS in a single file where possible.

### Contributing

To contribute, you'll need [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) installed. Fork and clone the repo, then visit the directory in the terminal and type `npm install`. After that you can simply run the `grunt` command to watch the files in the project. It'll automatically lint, test, compile, and minify the plugin files so you can just code.
