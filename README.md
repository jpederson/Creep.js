Creep.js
=========

Quickly add smooth scrolling to any links in your site using this simple plugin.


What You Need
=========

The only file you need (besides a jQuery library) is jquery.creep.min.js. The included css file is only for the example page. Since it's so small, it should ideally get minified and included with your other JS in a single file where possible.
